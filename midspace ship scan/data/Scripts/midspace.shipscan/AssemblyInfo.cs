// The AssemblyInfo isn't promoted by KeenSWH to be included in their 'script' mods.
// So it may not work in the future.
// Currently is does work, and it provides identifiable information in the compiled runtime 
// if any ever attempt to decompile it directly.

// I do not recommend changing the version. This will probably cause runtime issue if the version number
// is changed after Space Engineers is loaded. Set it at 1.0.0.0, and leave it like that.
